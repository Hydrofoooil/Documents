#  Notes From a Beginner in AI and Robotics

[cs231n_notes](./cs231n_notes) are handwritten lecture notes of Stanford cs231n course, which is an intro to deep learning in CV and is mainly about neural networks for image classification tasks.

---

[NLP_intro](./NLP_intro) contains a handwritten note mainly refering to the first half of Stanford cs224n course. It covers from word2vec, RNN, LSTM, self-attention all the way to transformer, and thus serves as a good intro to NLP(natural language processing). It's relatively not so beginner-friendly as it is mainly about the underlying logic of how these models work, and requires some prior knowledge in neural networks(refer to [cs231n_notes](./cs231n_notes)).

There is also code examples in the dirctory showing how a classic transformer is built and trained using PyTorch, with line-by-line comments that helps making out the code and syntax.
