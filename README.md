#  Notes From A Beginner in AI and Robotics

[cs231n_notes](./cs231n_notes) are handwritten lecture notes of Stanford cs231n course which is an intro to deep learning in CV and is mainly about neural networks for picture classification tasks.

[NLP_intro](./NLP_intro.pdf) is a handwritten note mainly refering to the first half of Stanford cs224n course. It covers from word2vec, RNN, LSTM, self-attention all the way to transformer, and thus serves as a good intro to NLP(natural language processing). It's not so beginner-friendly as it is mainly about the underlying logic of how these models works, and requires some prior knowledge in neural networks(refer to [cs231n_notes](./cs231n_notes)).
